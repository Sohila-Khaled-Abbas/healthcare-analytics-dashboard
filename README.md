## Key Metrics and DAX Formulas

### 1. Average Wait Time
```dax
Avg Wait Time = AVERAGE(Waitlist[Wait Time (Days)])
```

### 2. Patient Distribution by Age Group
```dax
Age Group = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    Patients[Age] < 18, "Child",
    Patients[Age] >= 18 && Patients[Age] < 65, "Adult",
    "Senior"
)
```

### 3. Top Utilized Services
```dax
Top Services = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Appointments[Service Type]),
    FILTER(Appointments, Appointments[Completed] = TRUE)
)
```
