## Key Metrics and DAX Formulas

### 1. Total Patients
```dax
Total Patients = COUNT(Patients[PatientID])
```

### 2. Average Wait Time
```dax
Avg Wait Time = AVERAGE(Appointments[Wait Time (Days)])
```

### 3. Specialty Utilization
```dax
Specialty Utilization = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNT(Appointments[Specialty]),
    FILTER(Appointments, Appointments[Completed] = TRUE)
)
```
